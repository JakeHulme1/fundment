# Fundment Coding Assessment

## Summary

Hi Josh! Iâ€™ve included some notes to explain how to use my implementation and make it as easy as possible for you to evaluate.

## Prerequisites & Setup

1. **Python version**
  This project requires Python 3.8 or later. I ran it in Python 3.13.3.

2. **Create virtual environment**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install dependencies**
  There is a `requirements.txt`, but the only third-party packages I used can be installed by:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy pytest
  ```

## Q1

### Total Time Weighted Return Calculator

To run the calculator:

```bash
python q1/main.py q1/test_data/sample_valuations.csv
```

As well as returning the pd.Series, the first and last 5 rows of the Series are printed to the terminal:
``` bash
2017-11-08    0.000000
2017-11-09    0.000000
2017-11-10    0.000000
2017-11-13    0.000000
2017-11-14    0.000000
                ...   
2018-01-30    0.014496
2018-01-31    0.010485
2018-02-01    0.006227
2018-02-02    0.001768
2018-02-05   -0.006563
Name: time_weighted_return, Length: 64, dtype: float64
```


### Unit tests

- `pytest q1` runs all unit and performance tests in the `q1/` folder.  
  - `test_utils.py`: file I/O and parsing testing.
  - `test_twr.py`: tests the functionality of the TWR algorithm. 
  - `test_perf.py`: demonstrates a simple scalability performance test (1,000 vs 10,000 rows) to show that the TWR algorithm remains O(n).


## Q2

### Filter Plan Calculator

To run the filter plan calculator:

```bash
python q2/filter_plan.py "abaa?"
```

This will print the solution (`"abaab"`) to the terminal.

### Unit tests

`pytest q2` runs all unit tests in the `q2/` folder.

By default, the algorithm will always pick `"a"` when both `"a"` and `"b"` are valid replacements for `"?"`. However, to guard against any future changes in tie-breaking (perhaps you later decide that filling with `"b"` is cheaper), the tests do not assert one fixed output. Instead, for each input it checks that the result belongs to a complete set of all valid solutions.
